# CODECADEMY 'JAMMMING' PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

## In this project, you will build a React web application called 'Jammming'. You will use your knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, and save it to their Spotify account.

We’ve broken the 'Jammming' project into 13 sections. Each section contains a descriptive header with an introductory step followed by a set of steps. The first step of each section will explain the goal and provide a brief overview of how we’ll likely accomplish it. Before you start the second step, try to plan how you would complete the section. 

This is a long project, so whether you’re completing assessments without the additional steps or banging your head against the wall trying to understand a hint, always use best practices and reflect on your growth.

Good luck!
