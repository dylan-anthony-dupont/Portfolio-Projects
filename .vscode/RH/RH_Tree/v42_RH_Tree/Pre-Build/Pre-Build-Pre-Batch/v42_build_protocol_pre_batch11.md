# v42 Build Protocol — pre–Batch 12
**Deliverable:** v42 *pre-build* manuscript plan (no PDF/TeX build yet in this step), plus artifacts ready to drive Batch‑12 prompts.

---

## 0) Inputs
- v41 locked manuscript + v41 NO‑GO appendix.
- GEO‑C4 canonical ingestion (legacy 1a + 1b synthesis).
- Existing δ‑policy conventions and frame map \(s\to u\to v\).

---

## 1) Patch application order (must follow)
1. Apply **Q42.1–Q42.2** (definitions + policies).
2. Apply **Q42.3** (toy FORCE lemma, full computation).
3. Apply **Q42.4** (UE reduction via IBP + MVT).
4. Insert **Q42.5** as the **ONLY ACTIVE BRICK** (boxed).
5. Insert **Q42.6–Q42.8** as open “support” lemmas (robustness/admissibility/resonance).
6. Apply **Q42.9–Q42.11** (NO‑GO demotions + audit + S6 update).

---

## 2) Internal consistency checks (non-negotiable)
### 2.1 Symbol hygiene
- \(a=2\beta-1\), \(m=2\gamma\) stated once and used consistently.
- \(h=\kappa\delta\) and \(\delta=\eta a/\log^2(m+3)\) appear in exactly one “policy” block.
- \(P_2\) definition matches the endpoint normalization (state explicitly if \(L^2\) norm is normalized by \(1/(2\pi)\) or not).

### 2.2 No hidden RH / circularity
- No statement “zeros at height m are on the hinge” is used anywhere.
- Shift‑admissibility must be formulated without assuming away zeros.

### 2.3 NO‑GO audit
- Ensure no-go statements do **not** forbid:
  - circular contours,
  - harmonic/Fourier projection endpoints,
  - commensurate coupling \(h\asymp\delta\),
  - integration-by-parts on \([0,2\pi]\).

If any NO‑GO lemma conflicts, it must be rewritten as: “NO‑GO for *sidewise-max* endpoints” (not for harmonic endpoints).

---

## 3) What v42 pre-build must make explicit
- The closure spine is now **FORCE vs UE** in a single harmonic channel.
- The single analytic frontier is **UE‑INPUT** (Q42.5).
- Everything else is either:
  - locked computation (toy FORCE + UE reduction), or
  - an explicit open robustness/admissibility lemma template.

---

## 4) Outputs of this step (files)
This protocol step should produce the following planning artifacts (not the manuscript build):
1. Integration Notes (this synthesis)
2. CR Master Dashboard (status + DAG)
3. v42 Next Build Plan (diff-only)
4. v42 Patch Queue
5. v42 Build Protocol

---

## 5) Batch‑12 prompt readiness checklist
Batch‑12 prompts must request **patch packets** that close:
- UE‑INPUT (Q42.5) with explicit constants,
- FORCE‑robustness (Q42.6),
- Shift‑admissibility (Q42.7),
- Resonance/N_eff condition (Q42.8),
and must include an S6 amplitude‑leak mapping cross-check.

(Engineering Batch‑12 prompts is the next step: part 1e.)
