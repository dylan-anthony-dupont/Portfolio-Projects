# 1 Months of Real Madrid's Training Data 

## Using the knowledge I have gained from my Sports Data Analyst Certification, I have imported 1 months worth of Real Madrid's training data and then converted it into a visual dashboard using PowerBI. 

## On top of R Programming Language, PowerBI, I can also use Tableau to create fixed and live dashboards to present to key stakeholders that are non-technical 

## Kind Regards, Dylan :)
