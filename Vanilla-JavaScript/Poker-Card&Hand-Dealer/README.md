# 'Poker Card/Hand Dealer, but applying abstract mathematics' (INTERMEDIATE JAVASCRIPT LOGIC DEMONSTRATION) PORTFOLIO PROJECT
=======================================================
## Project Description and personal thoughts and Ideas:
-------------------------------------------------------
### Creating a Poker hand/card dealer
+ **Poker hand/card dealer (2 unique cards) per player**
+ Allow the client to enter the number of players (min 2)
+ Deal a random hand to each player
+ The 3 main different pieces of random data can be:
1. Suit of card
2. Number/figure of card
3. Random Small (thus Big Blind) minimum wagers to play.
4. A 4th extra random data point: randomly allocate small and big blinds to 2 players.
-------------------------------------------------------
## Highlighted complexities:
-------------------------------------------------------
+ factory function to generate random cards as objects
+ Setting up loop based on user input (no. players)
+ assigning UNIQUE cards to players with no duplicates is actually a very complex operation (at least the way I have done it haha)
+ Min number of players to be 2.
+ after looking into poker documentation, max players using 1 deck = **22** (22*2 + 1(burn)+3(flop) + 1(burn)+1(turn) + 1(burn)+1(river) = 52)
-------------------------------------------------------
## Key Objectives:
-------------------------------------------------------
+ Build a random generator program using JavaScript
+ Use Git version control
+ Use the command line
+ Develop locally on your computer
-------------------------------------------------------
## Prerequisites:
-------------------------------------------------------
+ Intermediate JavaScript
+ Abstract Mathematical expertise
+ Git and GitHub
+ Command Line
-------------------------------------------------------
## How to use my program:
-------------------------------------------------------
+ Download the program onto your computer and open it in your Integrated Development Environment (IDE), I use Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
+ Read the comments!
+ You will see in the first few lines a comment asking you to amend the value assigning the number of players to a number of your liking.
+ Once assigned, save the program with any updates, if any at all, and run the program. See what it outputs!
+ There are a few comments near the end of the program that you can uncomment to change the output and see under the hood of certain features if you would like to see the inner workings in greater detail. On top of that, throughout the programme, I have included descriptive comments labelling each section.
