# C++ Prime Number Tool — Sieve of Eratosthenes Simulation

## Description
This is a simple yet educational C++ program that identifies and displays all **prime numbers** up to a user-defined limit using the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** — a classic algorithm in number theory.

It includes visualisation of which numbers are marked prime, step-by-step sieve progress, and clean console output, making it ideal for:
- Strengthening C++ fundamentals
- Exploring algorithmic logic
- Beginning number theory applications

## Features
- Accepts user input to define the prime limit  
- Implements Sieve of Eratosthenes efficiently  
- Provides visual feedback of each step  
- Fully commented code for easy understanding  

## How to Run
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ -o primesieve primesieve.cpp
