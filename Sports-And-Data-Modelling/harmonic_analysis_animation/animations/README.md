# My Own Independent Maths Research Animations 

These files are just examples of animations I have been plotting, investigating, and cross-referencing while I am exploring convergence properties at the intersection of number theory, complex analysis, and harmonic analysis, a personal passion project I believe holds the potential to contribute meaningfully to the field. 

All Animations are derived using my formulas found in my formulas file.
