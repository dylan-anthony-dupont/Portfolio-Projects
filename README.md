# Portfolio-Projects

## In this repository, I will archive more substantial or noteworthy Projects I have already completed.

The first few Projects added to this repository will be challenge projects I have completed while working through the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Career Path Course in my spare time.

## I hope you enjoy what you see, and I'd appreciate any constructive criticism if you spot something that could be done better.

## Kind Regards, Dylan :)
